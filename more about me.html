<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>Last summer, I worked as a Digital Marketing Intern at Northwestern Mutual. As an intern, I reported to 3 different teams: Social Media, Media, and Web & Digital Experience. Although this internship only lasted 3 months, the experience was invaluable and very rewarding as it provided me with a deeper understanding of marketing at a corporate level. Currently, I also work as a Digital Marketing Intern at the Wisconsin School of Business in the Multicultural Center. In this role, I work on creating and sending out email campaigns to students to inform them of the MC's upcoming events and opportunities. I also plan and create posts for their social media accounts to help spread the word about what goes on in the center. This experience is extremely valuable to me as it allows me to connect with other like-minded students and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within the business school.</p>

<h2>Personal Life</h2>
<p>As mentioned on my home page, I'm originally from Brookfield, Wisconsin. I was born and raised in WI alongside my parents and my two older siblings, Maggie and Brian. I feel like I've always had an eye for creativity, but I also wanted to pursue a career in business in hopes of being able to live in a big city one day. Through a program at my high school, I was able to work for a local company as a Social Media Marketing Intern during my senior year. I really enjoyed this internship and realized I could make a career out of this experience. So, I decided to study marketing at the Business School at UW-Madison! And these past 3 years have been nothing short of amazing. :)</p>
